In a dark blue forest,
Where aspens tremble,
The flowers sigh,
And glow among the trees.

The chapel bell yonder,
Bursting in the air,
And clear and solemn the words:
"We are gathered here,
That we are safe from all harm,
And haven for evermore."

The chapel bell doth ring,
With happy, sad tones;
And deep in the woods,
Where the butterflies soothed,
Lift their sighing hands
To heaven on high.

And in the morning,
The priest,
With the white white mustache,
Stirred,
His wine
```
